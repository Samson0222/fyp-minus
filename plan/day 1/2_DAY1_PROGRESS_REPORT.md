# üìä DAY 1 PROGRESS REPORT

This document summarizes the **development progress and technical implementation** from Day 1.

## ‚úÖ **Objectives Achieved**

All planned objectives for Day 1 were successfully met:

-   [x] **Voice Pipeline Foundation**: A functional pipeline with mock FastRTC and LLM integration was established.
-   [x] **Gemma 3n LLM Service**: A service for connecting to the Gemma 3n model was created, complete with a mock mode for API-key-free development.
-   [x] **Gmail & Calendar Voice Commands**: Basic voice command functionality for both platforms was implemented using mock data.
-   [x] **API Infrastructure**: A complete set of REST API endpoints for voice control was developed and tested.
-   [x] **Testing Framework**: A comprehensive, automated testing suite was built to validate all new components.
-   [x] **Dual Input & Mock Mode**: The system was designed from the ground up to support both voice/text inputs and to operate in a mock-first environment.

## üèóÔ∏è **Implemented Architecture**

The system was built following the planned architecture, emphasizing scalability and testability.

### **1. Dual-Input Pipeline**

A unified pipeline processes both text and (simulated) voice commands, ensuring consistent behavior.

```
Text Input ‚îÄ‚îê
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí LLM Service ‚îÄ‚Üí Platform Router ‚îÄ‚Üí Service Layer ‚îÄ‚Üí Response
Voice Input ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### **2. Mock-First Development**

All services were built with a mock layer, enabling full-featured development and testing without live API keys. This was a key factor in the rapid progress.

```
Real APIs (Future) ‚Üê‚îÄ Mock Layer (Active) ‚Üê‚îÄ Service Layer ‚Üê‚îÄ API Router
```

### **3. Platform-Agnostic LLM Router**

The `llm_service.py` was designed to be platform-agnostic, converting natural language into a structured JSON format that can be easily routed to the correct service (Gmail, Calendar, etc.).

---

## üìÅ **Components Developed**

### **1. Enhanced Voice Server (`voice_server.py`)**

-   **Purpose**: The central engine for voice processing.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   Wake word detection logic (`"hey minus"`).
    -   State management (`IDLE`, `LISTENING`, `PROCESSING`).
    -   Simulated silence detection and stop word recognition.
    -   WebSocket broadcasting for real-time state updates to a frontend.

### **2. Gemma 3n LLM Service (`app/core/llm_service.py`)**

-   **Purpose**: To parse natural language into structured commands.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   Code to integrate with Google's free-tier `gemma-2-2b-it` model.
    -   A **fully functional mock mode** that uses pattern matching to simulate AI responses, allowing the entire system to work without an API key.
    -   Graceful error handling for JSON parsing.

### **3. Gmail Voice Service (`app/services/gmail_service.py`)**

-   **Purpose**: To handle voice commands related to Gmail.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   `process_voice_command` method to route actions like `read_unread` and `compose`.
    -   **Mock data layer** providing realistic, voice-formatted email summaries.
    -   Full implementation of the Google Gmail API (OAuth2, message parsing), which is currently bypassed by the mock mode.

### **4. Calendar Voice Service (`app/services/calendar_service.py`)**

-   **Purpose**: To handle voice commands related to Google Calendar.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   Methods for checking the schedule (`get_today_schedule_voice`) and creating events (`create_event_voice`).
    -   **Mock data layer** providing a sample daily schedule for testing.
    -   Placeholder for real Google Calendar API integration.

### **5. Voice API Router (`app/routers/voice.py`)**

-   **Purpose**: To provide REST endpoints for controlling the voice assistant.
-   **Endpoints Created**:
    -   `POST /text-command`: To process commands via text.
    -   `GET /state`: To monitor the assistant's current state (`IDLE`, `LISTENING`, etc.).
    -   `GET /health`: A health check endpoint for the service.

### **6. Testing Framework (`tests/`)**

-   **Purpose**: To ensure the reliability and correctness of the new components.
-   **Key Files**:
    -   `test_voice_pipeline.py`: Validates the core voice-to-response workflow.
    -   `test_gmail_voice.py`: Tests all Gmail voice commands against mock data.
    -   `test_calendar_voice.py`: Tests all Calendar voice commands against mock data.
-   **Results**: Achieved a 100% pass rate across all automated tests.

This comprehensive implementation provides a solid and fully testable foundation for the voice assistant.
