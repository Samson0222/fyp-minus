  - Returns: `{"state": "idle", "listening": false}`

### Gmail Commands
- [ ] **Read Emails**: 
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/text-command" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "Read my unread emails"}'
  ```
  - ✅ Returns: Mock email list with 3 emails
  - ✅ Response time: < 3 seconds
  - ✅ Format: `{"success": true, "response": "You have 3 unread emails..."}`

- [ ] **Compose Email**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/text-command" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "Compose email to john about meeting"}'
  ```
  - ✅ Returns: Email draft confirmation
  - ✅ Mentions recipient "john" and subject "meeting"

### Calendar Commands
- [ ] **Check Schedule**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/text-command" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "What is my schedule today?"}'
  ```
  - ✅ Returns: Mock schedule with 3 events
  - ✅ Includes event times and descriptions

- [ ] **Create Event**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/text-command" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "Schedule a meeting at 3 PM"}'
  ```
  - ✅ Returns: Event creation confirmation
  - ✅ Acknowledges the 3 PM time

### Voice State Management
- [ ] **Activate Voice**: `curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/activate-voice"`
  - ✅ Returns: `{"success": true, "message": "Voice mode activated"}`
  
- [ ] **Check Active State**: `curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/state"`
  - ✅ Returns: `{"state": "listening", "listening": true}`
  
- [ ] **Deactivate Voice**: `curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/deactivate-voice"`
  - ✅ Returns: `{"success": true, "message": "Voice mode deactivated"}`

---

## 🎯 Command Recognition Testing

### LLM Platform Detection
Test if the LLM correctly identifies platform and action:

- [ ] **Gmail Commands** (should detect `platform: "gmail"`):
  - "Read my emails" → `gmail/read_unread`
  - "Check my inbox" → `gmail/read_unread`
  - "Send a message to sarah" → `gmail/compose`
  - "Find emails from John" → `gmail/search`

- [ ] **Calendar Commands** (should detect `platform: "calendar"`):
  - "What's my schedule?" → `calendar/check_today`
  - "Am I free at 2 PM?" → `calendar/check_availability`
  - "Schedule a meeting" → `calendar/create_event`
  - "Check my calendar" → `calendar/check_today`

---

## 📊 Performance & Quality Validation

### Response Quality
- [ ] **Natural Language**: Responses sound conversational, not robotic
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: Responses mention specific details from commands
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Unknown commands get helpful error messages
- [ ] **Consistency**: Same command gives similar responses multiple times

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] **Response Time**: All commands respond within 3 seconds
- [ ] **API Reliability**: No timeouts or connection errors
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Server stays stable during multiple requests
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Server handles malformed requests gracefully

---

## 🎭 Mock vs Real Verification

### Expected Mock Behavior (This is CORRECT)
- [ ] **Gmail**: Returns 3 mock emails from John, Sarah, and Team
- [ ] **Calendar**: Returns 3 mock events (Standup, Lunch, Client Call)
- [ ] **LLM**: Uses pattern-based responses (if no GOOGLE_API_KEY)
- [ ] **API Keys**: Missing keys don't break functionality

### Verify Mock Data Quality
- [ ] **Realistic Content**: Mock emails have realistic subjects/senders
- [ ] **Proper Timing**: Mock events have reasonable times
- [ ] **Varied Responses**: Different commands give different responses
- [ ] **Professional Tone**: All responses sound business-appropriate

---

## 🔍 Edge Case Testing

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] **Unknown Commands**: "Turn on the lights" → Helpful error message
- [ ] **Empty Input**: `{"text": ""}` → Proper error handling
- [ ] **Invalid JSON**: Malformed requests → 400 error with message
- [ ] **Server Restart**: Server recovers gracefully after restart

### Boundary Conditions
- [ ] **Very Long Commands**: 500+ character input → Still processes
- [ ] **Special Characters**: Commands with quotes/symbols → No crashes
- [ ] **Multiple Requests**: 10 rapid requests → All succeed
- [ ] **Command Variations**: Different phrasings → Same platform detection

---

## 🏆 Final Validation

### Overall System Check
- [ ] **All Automated Tests**: 100% pass rate
- [ ] **All API Endpoints**: 7/7 working correctly
- [ ] **Command Recognition**: 80%+ accuracy for platform detection
- [ ] **No Critical Errors**: No crashes or unhandled exceptions

### Day 1 Objectives Verification
- [ ] **✅ Voice Pipeline**: LLM integration working
- [ ] **✅ Gmail Integration**: Basic read/compose commands working
- [ ] **✅ Calendar Integration**: Schedule check/create working
- [ ] **✅ API Infrastructure**: All endpoints responsive
- [ ] **✅ State Management**: Voice activation/deactivation working
- [ ] **✅ Error Handling**: Graceful failures with helpful messages

### Ready for Day 2?
