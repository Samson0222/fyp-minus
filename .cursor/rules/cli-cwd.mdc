# CLI Command Execution Policy for this Project

- All commands MUST be executed from the repository root.
- Never use `cd` to change directories unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **Always use Windows Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) to run all commands**, not PowerShell or other shells.
- If a sub-app or subfolder needs to run a command, use full paths or workspace flags (e.g., `npm --workspace frontend run dev`) instead of `cd`.
- If running a script, always use:  
  `cmd.exe /C "your command here"`
- Never use programmatic or REPL execution (e.g., running scripts directly in Node/Python/REPL).  
  Always execute using shell commands, as if typing them in Command Prompt.
- If working in a Windows environment, never use PowerShell for Node/NPM scripts; always use Command Prompt.
- For `npm run dev` or similar, the agent should produce:  
  `cmd.exe /C "cd frontend && npm run dev"`
- If a binary like `vite` is needed, the agent should use:  
  `cmd.exe /C "cd frontend && node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js"`

- Never use PowerShell or PowerShell-specific commands.
