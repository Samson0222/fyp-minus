### üîë Authentication Flow (Google OAuth2)
To ensure secure and reusable access to Google services (Gmail, Calendar, Docs), a centralized OAuth2 authentication flow has been implemented. This flow is designed to be easily adopted by any new component or module that requires Google API access.

#### **Backend (`FastAPI`)**
The core logic resides in `backend/app/routers/auth.py`.

1.  **Unified Scopes**: All required Google API permissions are consolidated into a single `GOOGLE_SCOPES` list located in `backend/app/core/config.py`. This ensures consistency and prevents scope conflicts between services.
2.  **Authorization Endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/google/authorize`)**:
    - This endpoint initiates the Google OAuth2 flow.
    - It generates an authorization URL and redirects the user to Google's consent screen.
3.  **Callback Endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/google/callback`)**:
    - After the user grants permission, Google redirects them back to this endpoint with an authorization `code`.
    - The backend exchanges this code for an `access_token` and, crucially, a `refresh_token`.
    - The complete credentials are saved to a user-specific file: `tokens/token_google_{user_id}.json`.
4.  **Status Endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/google/status`)**:
    - A simple, unprotected endpoint that any frontend component can call.
    - It checks if a valid `token_google_{user_id}.json` exists for the current user.
    - Returns `{"authenticated": true}` or `{"authenticated": false}`.
5.  **Service-Level Authentication**:
    - Services like `GmailService` and `GoogleCalendarService` are instantiated with a `user_id`.
    - Their constructors are responsible for loading the user's token from the corresponding file.
    - If the token is missing or invalid (and cannot be refreshed), the service raises a `401 Unauthorized` HTTPException, preventing backend crashes and providing clear error signals to the frontend.

#### **Frontend (`React`)**
The frontend flow is designed to be robust and user-friendly.

1.  **The Settings Page (`/settings`)**:
    - This is the central hub for authentication management.
    - It contains a "Connect Google Account" button. Clicking this button navigates the user to the backend's `/api/v1/auth/google/authorize` endpoint, starting the process.
2.  **Protected Components (`Calendar.tsx`, `Inboxes.tsx`, etc.)**:
    - On component mount, they first call the `/api/v1/auth/google/status` endpoint.
    - **If `authenticated: true`**: The component proceeds to fetch its specific data (e.g., calendar events, emails).
    - **If `authenticated: false`**: The component immediately renders the `UnauthorizedPage` component, avoiding unnecessary API calls and potential errors.
3.  **The Reusable `UnauthorizedPage.tsx` Component**:
    - A standardized view shown to unauthenticated users.
    - It clearly states that a connection is required.
    - It provides a "Go to Settings" button, directing the user to the correct page to resolve the issue, creating a smooth user journey.

#### **Development & Testing (Stub User)**
During development, the `get_current_user` dependency in `backend/app/main.py` is stubbed to facilitate testing without requiring a full authentication flow. This is a temporary measure.

-   **Stub Implementation**: The function returns a hard-coded user object.
-   **User ID Requirement**: The `user_id` in the stubbed object **must be a valid UUID** (e.g., `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"`).
-   **Reason**: This is necessary to satisfy the foreign key constraints in the database, where tables like `tasks` or `monitored_chats` link back to a central `user_profiles` table using a UUID. This same `user_id` is used to name the user's Google credential file (`tokens/token_google_{user_id}.json`), creating a direct link between the authenticated Google session and the user's data in the database. Using a non-UUID string like `"test_user_001"` will cause database insertion errors.
user_id=uuid=cbede3b0-2f68-47df-9c26-09a46e588567
-   **Production Goal**: This stub will be replaced by a proper JWT-based authentication mechanism that extracts the real user UUID from the token.

#### **Implementation Flow for New Pages**
To add a new page that requires Google authentication:

1.  In the new React component, use a `useEffect` hook to call `/api/v1/auth/google/status`.
2.  Based on the result, either fetch the required data or render the `<UnauthorizedPage serviceName="Your New Service" />`.
3.  Ensure the backend service for the new feature correctly loads the `token_google_{user_id}.json` and handles potential `401` errors.

### ü™µ Centralized Logging System
To improve debugging and maintainability, a centralized logging system has been implemented in the backend. This addresses the initial problem of inconsistent and unreliable logging across different modules.

#### **Backend Implementation (`FastAPI`)**
1.  **Central Configuration**: A `setup_logging()` function is defined in `backend/app/core/config.py`. This function acts as the single source of truth for all logging settings, including log level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG), format, and output handlers (e.g., console).
2.  **Initialization on Startup**: The `setup_logging()` function is called from the `startup_event` in `backend/app/main.py`. This guarantees that logging is fully configured before any other part of the application starts, ensuring all log messages are captured reliably.
3.  **Standardized Usage**: All modules continue to use the standard Python practice (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`), which now automatically inherits the central configuration.

#### **Benefits for Future Development**
This centralized approach significantly streamlines development and debugging:
- **Simplified Debugging**: To see more detailed logs, a developer only needs to change the log level in `config.py` (e.g., from `logging.INFO` to `logging.DEBUG`). This change is instantly applied across the entire backend, providing deep insight without modifying multiple files.
- **Consistency & Readability**: All log messages now follow a uniform format (`timestamp - logger_name - level - message`), making the application's behavior easier to trace and understand.
- **Maintainability**: If logging needs to be directed to a file or an external service in the future, the change only needs to be made in the `setup_logging()` function, simplifying maintenance.
